## Annotations

- Annotations and decorators are practically the same.
- Annotations are Angular specific and are implemented by TypeScript decorators
- There are different type of decorators. Check out the decorators chapter for more details.
- The most commonly used decorators are the class decorators.
- Angular uses class decorators to define component annotation.
- Below is a simple component annotation using a class decorator:

```typescript
@component({ ... });
class MyComponent {}
```
