# Object Orientation

Interfaces and classes are heavily used in Object Oriented Programming. In this chapter we will focus on these topics.
# Interface

- An Interface is defined using the `interface` keyword
- Interfaces are used only during compilation time to check types
- By convention, interface definitions start with an `I`, e.g. : `IPoint`
- Interfaces are used in classical object oriented programming as a design tool
- Interfaces don't contain implementations
- They provide definitions only
- When an object implements an interface, it must adhere to the contract defined by the interface
- An interface defines what properties and methods an object must implement
- If an object implements an interface, it must adhere to the contract. If it doesn't the compiler will let us know.
- Interfaces also define custom types

## Basic Interface

Below is an example of an Interface that defines two properties and three methods that implementers should provide implementations for:

```typescript
interface IMyInterface {
  // some properties
  id: number;
  name: string;

  // some methods
  method(): void;
  methodWithReturnVal():number;
  sum(nums: number[]):number;
}
```

Using the interface above we can create an object that adheres to the interface:

```typescript
let myObj: IMyInterface = {
  id: 2,
  name: 'some name',

  method() { console.log('hello'); },
  methodWithReturnVal () { return 2; },
  sum(numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce( (a,b) => { return a + b } );
  }
};
```

Notice that we had to provide values to **all** the properties defined by the Interface, and the implementations for **all** the methods defined by the Interface.

And then of course you can use your object methods to perform operations:

```typescript
let sum = myObj.sum([1,2,3,4,5]); // -> 15
```

## Some Angular Interfaces

Angular uses interfaces all over the place. The interfaces that are used very often are the *LifeCycle Hooks*.

### LifeCycle Interfaces

```typescript
export interface OnChanges {
  ngOnChanges(changes: {
    [key: string]: SimpleChange
  });
}

export interface OnInit {
  ngOnInit();
}

export interface OnDestroy {
  ngOnDestroy();
}

```
# Classes

- Classes are heavily used in classical object oriented programming
- It defines what an object is and what it can do
- A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by a name
- By convention, the name of the class start with an uppercase letter
- A class can be used to create multiple objects (instances) of the same class
- An object is created from a class using the `new` keyword
- A class can have a `constructor` which is called when an object is made from the class
- Properties of a class are called instance variables and its functions are called the class methods
- Access modifiers can be used to make them public or private
- The instance variables are attached to the instance itself but not the prototype
- Methods however are attached to the prototype object as opposed to the instance itself
- Classes can inherit functionality from other classes, but you should [favor composition over inheritance](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3#.oc5pdevwh) or make sure you know [when to use it](https://medium.com/@dtinth/es6-class-classical-inheritance-20f4726f4c4#.xdif2m42e)
- Classes can implement interfaces

Let's make a class definition for a car and incrementally add more things to it.

## Distance Instance Variable

The `Car` class definition can be very simple and can define only a single instance variable that all cars can have:

```typescript
class Car {
  distance: number;
}
```

- `Car` is the name of the class, which also defines the custom type `Car`
- `distance` is a property that tracks the distance that car has traveled
- Distance is of type `number` and only accepts `number` type.

Now that we have the definition for a car, we can create a car from the definition:

```typescript
let myCar:Car = new Car();
myCar.distance = 0;
```

- `myCar:Car` means that `myCar` is of type `Car`
- `new Car()` creates an instance from the `Car` definition.
- `myCar.distance = 0` sets the initial value of the `distance` to 0 for the newly created `car`

## Adding a Method

So far our car doesn't have any definitions for any actions. Let's define a `move` method that all the cars can have:

```typescript
class Car {
  distance: number;
  move():void {
    this.distance += 1;
  };
}
```

- `move():void` means that `move` is a method that does not return any value, hence `void`.
- The body of the method is defined in `{ }`
- `this` refers to the instance, therefore `this.distance` points to the `distance` property defined on the car instance.
- Now you can call the `move` method on the car instance to increment the `distance` value by 1:

```typescript
myCar.move();
console.log(myCar.distance) // -> 1
```

## Adding a constructor

A `constructor` is a special method that gets called when an instance is created from a class. Let's add a constructor to the `Car` class that initializes the `distance` value to 0. This means that all the cars that are crated from this class, will have their `distance` set to 0 automatically:

```typescript
class Car {
  distance: number;
  constructor () {
    this.distance = 0;
  };
  move():void {
    this.distance += 1;
  };
}
```

- `constructor()` is called automatically when a new car is created
- The body of the constructor is defined in the `{ }`

So now when we create a car, the `distance` property is automatically set to 0.

## Using Access Modifiers

If you wanted to tell the compiler that the `distance` variable is private and can only be used by the object itself, you can use the `private` modifier before the name of the property:

```typescript
class Car {
  private distance: number;
  constructor () {
    ...
  };
  ...
}
```

Access modifiers can be used in different places. Check out the access modifiers chapter for more details.

## Implementing an Interface

Classes can implement one or multiple interfaces. We can make the `Car` class implement two interfaces:

**interfaces**

```typescript
interface ICarProps {
  distance: number;
}
interface ICarMethods {
  move():void;
}
```
Making the `Car` class implement the interfaces:

```typescript
class Car implements ICarProps, ICarMethods {
  distance: number;
  constructor () {
    this.distance = 5;
  };
  move():void {
    this.distance += 1;
  };
}
```

The above example is silly, but it shows the point that a class can implement one or more interfaces. Now if the class does not provide implementations for any of the interfaces, the compiler will complain. For example, if we leave out the `distance` instance variable, the compiler will print out the following error:


>error TS2420: Class 'Car' incorrectly implements interface 'ICarProps'.
  Property 'distance' is missing in type 'Car'.
